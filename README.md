# 📊 Investment Firm Data Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **700 firms** based on various financial and business attributes to assist an **investment firm** in making data-driven decisions. It involves **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling** using **Excel and statistical techniques**.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of **9 key attributes** for 700 firms:
- **sales**: Revenue in millions of dollars.
- **capital**: Net stock of property, plant, and equipment.
- **patents**: Number of patents granted.
- **randd**: R&D stock in millions of dollars.
- **employment**: Number of employees (in 1000s).
- **sp500**: Whether the firm is part of the S&P 500 (Yes/No).
- **tobinq**: Tobin's Q ratio (market vs replacement value).
- **value**: Stock market value.
- **institutions**: Proportion of stock owned by institutions.

## 📊 Key Analysis & Methodology
The project includes:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handling missing values (imputing with mean).
   - Converting categorical variables to numeric (e.g., S&P 500 membership).
   - Generating summary statistics & visualizations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Histograms for sales distribution.
   - Covariance & correlation matrix for relationships between variables.

3. **Regression Models**
   - **Simple Linear Regression** (Sales ~ Value)
   - **Multiple Linear Regression** (Sales ~ All Variables)
   - **Best Fit Model** (Using only significant variables)

4. **Business Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identifying factors that influence sales the most.
   - Predicting potential investment opportunities.

## 📊 Key Findings
- The **Value** variable plays a crucial role in predicting **Sales**.
- Some variables have **low significance** in the regression model.
- A refined model using **significant variables** improves prediction accuracy.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel** (Data Cleaning, Analysis, Regression)
- **Statistics** (Regression Modeling, Covariance, Correlation)
